# Interference

The work «Interference» is a kinetic spatial installation. In one corner of the room, two acrylic glass tubes stand diagonally opposite each other. In these float green polystyrene balls in a cyclic up and down movement. The spheres are connected by a line of white light which is projected onto the wall in real time.
