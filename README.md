# Interference

The work «Interference» is a kinetic spatial installation. In one corner of the room, two acrylic glass tubes stand diagonally opposite each other. In these float green polystyrene balls in a cyclic up and down movement. The spheres are connected by a line of white light which is projected onto the wall in real time.
In physics, interference is the encounter of all kinds of waves. Light can be described as an electromagnetic wave. In this type of wave, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other. Light can also be understood as radiation of particles, the photons. This connection is known as wave-particle dualism.
The work attempts to translate incomprehensible phenomena of physics into a sensual experience.
